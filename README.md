My personal website containing my portfolio and blog. Created with React and Firebase.

The blog was created entirely from scratch.

* For creating content, [react-brandywine-editor](https://github.com/alec-ng/react-brandywine-editor) was built to serve as a block based WYSIWYG editor. It is also available as an npm package.
* For content management, [brandywine-cms] was built to manage content created with __react-brandywine-editor__ and interact with my Firebase backend.
